# Efficiency Analysis of Online Campaigns

## Project Overview
This mini-project analyzes the effectiveness of online advertising campaigns.  
The analysis includes SQL queries in **PostgreSQL (via DBeaver)** and **BigQuery**, with results visualized in **Looker Studio**.

## Datasets
The project was based on two datasets:

- **Google Analytics 4 public e-commerce dataset (Google Store, 2020â€“2021)** â€“ available via BigQuery.  
- **Google & Facebook Ads dataset (2020â€“2022)** â€“ internal dataset provided by my training program (not publicly available).

**Main goals:**
- Identify patterns of campaign effectiveness
- Calculate ROMI and highlight top-performing campaigns
- Build a conversion funnel and detect drop-off points
- Compare landing page performance
- Explore correlation between engagement and purchases
